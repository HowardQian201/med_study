text = """This is our second lecture, and it's about dermal ulcers.
specifically leg ulcers. These leg ulcers are very important for a primary care. Physician.
They are very common, they are debilitating.
and you have to know about them.
1st of all, look at these objectives, for we are going to classify these answers
and 5 headaches, venous arterial neuropathic
pressure ulcer. That's the decubitus ulcer and the other causes ulcers due to other causes.
Let's start with Venus ulcers.
These chronic, these type of chronic ulcers are very common in the lower leg.
1% of the elderly population, middle-aged and elderly, are affected, and these ulcers
are precipitated, or a cause of minor injury most of the time that the person cannot even remember
There are several factors here, and
you know, diabetes is also common, and this may be
superimposed on diabetic patients, but also don't forget that diabetes. Patients also have vascular problems and neural problems, so they will have diabetic patients will have venous ulcers and neuropathic ulcers as well. At the same time.
Frequently there are several factors, and venous arterial, neuropathic infective causes may overlap, especially in diabetics.
When you look at here, you're going to see see that most of the ulcers are venous ulcers.
the leg ulcers. We are talking about almost 50%.
And then the other type of ulcers are equally distributed in the remaining 50%
tells you the importance of venous type of ulcers.
This is very important.
This illustration tells us, according to the answer, etiology, arterial diabetic, that is the neuropathic.
the neuropathic portion of the diabetes and venous insufficiency ulcers.
They are clinical appearance, the ulcer location and treatment.
This is very important circle. This. This is exam in the exams. You are going to be responsible for this. And briefly, let's have a look.
1st of all, we are talking about Venus ulcers. Right now.
medial malleolus, so venous ulcers are on the medial side of the lower foot in the medial malleolus area.
and the clinical appearance is beefy red brown staining of skin.
These ulcers have a pigmented area around them.
Mayfy red, brown staining of the skin, very helpful for identifying them as Venus, and the treatment in these ulcers.
the treatment of these ulcers, compression and venous intervention. Let's go over the other 2.
We are going to cover them individually, but in the arterial type of ulcers the locations are toes
and distal forefoot.
It should go away.
What happened?
Okay?
Alright.
I don't know what happened. Okay.
Toes and distal forefoot.
and the appearance is gangrene. Usually dry earth by gangrene and revascularization is the treatment and the diabetic neuropathic ulcers are usually on weight-bearing surface. So these are really the
not the dorsal, but the plantar aspect of the foot weight bearing heels.
Offloading. These have callous and heaped up borders and offloading is a treatment in these ones.
Okay?
And here
the causes of lower limb ulceration. Let's have a look at that again. This is what we sent
basically, the Venus ulcers are the blue ones.
Look at the Venus. Venus are usually medial side, and there is the neuropathic ulcers are weight bearing
heel poorfoot and arterial ulcers are usually dorsal aspects, and lateral. Malleolus, as you can see.
medial is venous. Lateral is arterial.
all right.
And again, this is an illustration. Showing. This is a chart showing us basically a little bit more in detail what we said, the venous type of ulcers that we are talking right now, malleolar and supramalolar, the medial aspect.
irregular slop borders, necrotic base, and fiber may be seen, and the pigment we were talking about lipodermatosclerosis
stasis dermatitis atrophy blanche pigmentation
and lymphedema are seen in the surrounding skin. I will show you a picture of each of them pain.
and also they are associated with varicose veins, and there is pain worse in the dependent state. This is important in the arterial ulcers.
This is the arterial we are going to talk about that pain worse. On elevation of the leg.
The venous ulcers pain wears on dependent portion. Dependent state.
Neuropathic is not associated with pain. There's usually no pain in neuropathic ulcers
all right.
Venous ulcers are due to chronic venous insufficiency.
and they almost always go with vertical swings.
Incompetent varicose veins, or superficial communicating veins are the causes of these type of ulcers.
and it may be associated with all kind of venous complications.
Prior thrombosis, cellulitis, immobility, fistulas, arterial fistulas neuromuscular dysfunction and these are more common in kleinfelter syndrome, Xxy phenotype.
There is high venous pressure, and that's the cause of capillary permeability, and the fibrin deposited along the capillaries
and ischemia, followed by necrosis, feel more comfortable when elevated, more painful when lowered.
This is what happens.
The venous circulation in the leg is mostly facilitated by muscle activity. These muscles. When they are compressed, they take the blood from the lower areas towards the heart.
and they have walls, as you can see.
But what happens in Venus insufficiency.
1st of all, the valves are not working, as you can see, they are not competent. You are having
reverse, blunt
flow and the reverse blood flow eventually affects the superficial veins, and that is when you have the varicose veins, incompetent valves, varicose veins.
and then you have edema fibrin deposition and pigmentation.
So this is the cause of the venous ulcers.
This is a little bit closer
to what we said. You see, there is Venus insufficiency, incompetent ones, and the pressure is
towards the superficial veins. And when you have these superficial veins dilated, you have varicose veins.
This darker area is pericappillary fibrin deposition.
and also there is ulceration here which is
our person, our interest today, and these are all due to poor muscle, pump activity, poor muscle pump.
and that has many causes as well.
Now let's look at the end result of finished insufficiency. When you have the
capillaries or vessels distended, as you can see, the endothelial gaps are widened.
You have leakage of fiber, energyn from the capillary walls.
There is capillary proliferation in the skin and postcapillary fiber in deposition.
and these also. This bleeding explains the pigment deposition as well in these areas.
So what are the signs of venous ulcers? Chronic lymphedema
brownie stipple pigmentation? I'll show you an example of that telangiectisia and white lacey scars, atrophy, blanche.
The description of atrophy bonches, telangiectasia, and white lacy scars stasis dermatitis that is due to
vaping from the that's due to leakage of the edema fluid from
from capillary is eventually causing in the skin either dry or weeping. Patches.
Varicose veins usually associated with the venous ulcers.
thrombosis, lipodermatosclerosis. And this is in duration
fibrosis in the dermis. You remember I mentioned that there's fibroblast activity going on in the subcutaneous tissue thickening, and you may have varicose epidermis. There's a name given to this elephantiasis nostra varicosa.
almost like elephant skin eventually thickening.
All right, let's see the examples. This is atrophy, Blanche, lacey, white scars.
and in the background there is some pigmentation characteristic of venous ulcers.
that is, stasis dermatitis, stasis dermatitisis with ulceration and those are the skin changes associated with this process.
and this is venous ulceration, usually on the medial malleolus around the medial malleolus, and associated with peripheral pigmentation
characteristic of finish and sufficiency.
Sharply marginated ulcers.
irregular bulsors, stasis, dermatitis, stasis dermatitis. You can see how how problematic these wounds can be and they don't heal. Unfortunately.
this is an extreme example of the Venus ulcer in the lowest link.
This happens to be on the lateral malleolus. Mostly mostly it is on the medial malleolus, but you can see them sometimes on the lateral malleolus as well.
and atrophy, blanche lipodermatosclerosis stasis dermatitis
all of them are seen around these venous ulcers. Atrophy. Blanche is skin thinning with this whitish areas. Right there. Let me show you atrophy, Blanche. This is atrophy blanche, and this is whitish area. Around. This is atrophy, Blanche.
and this is squamous cell carcinoma in a longstanding, venous ulcers. Don't forget that
these ulcers trauma non-healing ulcers may be the cause of both basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas.
That circular mark in the center is the area where the cancer started.
and any non-healing ulcer that has some abnormal looking.
bleeding, abnormal, has an abnormal look, and it bleeds. And then there is some elevation there. You have to think about that.
And this is chronic, venous insufficiency. Again, edema on the right side, you can see but the
how significant it can be. And again.
this is on the medium mile. In this one.
Look at them all the changes around them are the changes listed, and with the venous ulcers
this one, and it's gray, irregular edges infected one gray wound edges indicating inflammation.
What are the complications?
The most rated complication is malignancy, the last one
but the others are more common infection, irritant dermatitis.
Allergic dermatitis, and then infection going into periosteum bone.
causing bony ankylosis of the ankle.
You will always have patients with venous ulcers. If you are going to be a primary care physician.
You have to be familiar with them, and you have to be familiar with how to manage them.
So diagnosis.
Usually you don't need these elaborate studies, but you can use flamography and sonography to demonstrate varicose veins.
Incompetency of the veins can be done by ultrasonography
and phleography usually not necessary. So how do you manage these venous ulcers?
1st of all, you have to decrease the edema, and that is done by stockings, usually compression stockings.
or dressings.
You have to avoid trauma because they are gonna cause ulcer and won't heal.
Sometimes you may have to block the vein by sclerotherapy.
Take out the stripping of the veins, all the varicose veins so that they don't create problems.
and then certain dressings. If they have ulcers.
if the infection is out of control. You can give antibiotics.
You have to debride the necrotic tissues. Take it out there, and
that's pretty much how you take care of this ulcer. Let's look at this, there's an algorithm for the diagnosis and treatment of these ulcers.
1st of all, clinical picture consistent with a venous ulcer. What are those medial mallolar ulcer, with surrounding fibrosis.
pigmentation, and associated varicosities. These are the ones that will tell you that this is a venous ulcer.
exclude arterial disease. So you have to be sure that this Venus ulcer
and assess the baseline predictors for healing wound bed preparation. So, if necessary, the abridement should be done.
and then compression heeled compression, stockings, not healed.
tissue, biopsy, reevaluate for infection and malignancy. See osteomyelitis and my leg nancy.
and then the final thing is alternative therapies plus compression tissue, engineered skin skin grafting. Those are in the
very, very advanced cases.
Sure arterial losses now, and arterial losses we mentioned here.
You can see that they are punched out with an acrotic base. Usually treasure sites, tolls.
peritibial, supramaleolar, lateral, mainly the most distal portion, atrophic and shiny skin
hair loss is another indication that there's some muscular insufficiency there, reactive hyperemia or palate.
Weak absent pulses are going to be confirmatory, that this patient of vascular problem pallor on elevation of the leg, and pain worse on elevation of the leg, as opposed to
the venous ulcers. When the pain is when you lower the leg.
arterial insufficiency is most often due to utter sclerosis.
and that will be your most common causes. But other causes of arterial insufficiency are listed there.
You can have one of these any any of these causing the arterial type of ulcer atherosclerosis
result in leg ulceration because of the ischemia and cholesterol emboli
pain at rest was marked at night.
when the pain, the leg is elevated, less perfused, and at night
intermittent claudication on exercise, intermittent pain.
And if you have this pain in the leg. Suddenly it may indicate an embolus.
What are the signs of arterial insufficiency in the skin? It's usually sinus, later pale, especially on elevation loss of hair, shiny and thin skin
and pulse. You are going to lose the pulse, pain related by leg in a dependent position, as opposed to venous ulcers. When you put in a depending position, the perfusion is going to be better, and the pain will be relieved.
They are painful, they are painful. These are painful ulcers as opposed to neuropathic ulcers that are not painful.
and they most often arise over bone prominences, prominences.
toes, heels, and maybe associated with minor trauma like venous ulcers.
Usually
As a result of trauma, a blackened area eventually may turn into an ulcer with a sharp
punched out borders that sloughing reveals a punched out ulcer with sharp borders.
and it may be so deep that you may see tendrils moving in the salt. So it's very
dramatic to see the patient coming, and then all the tendons moving, and you can see them from in the in the ulcer bed.
Very dramatic. Okay, these are
ulcers due to atherosclerosis. And you see that these are distal and prominent bony prominences.
These are the areas most subject to ischemia. Basically.
you see, this is different than venous ulcers. It's on the dorsal sharp borders.
distal sharp borders with some hyperemia around it.
And you don't have those pigmentation fibrosis white exchange atrophy blanche lipodermatosclerosis, stasis, dermatitis, all associated with venous ulcers. They are not there. You may see some hyperemia like this.
another one sharply demarcated borders absence of venus
problems and necrotic base. Another thing is necrotic base. In this ulcers you may see a necrotic base
which is uncommon in both neuropathic and venous ulcers. Okay.
well, how do you? How do you diagnose this doppler? Doppler studies and arteriography? Ultrasound may help actually, management.
Smoking is important. You have to let them stop smoking.
You have to let them have increased collateral circulation, circulation, and it's usually by exercise.
more exercise, more collateral circulation.
collection of factors that leads to arteriosclerosis, hyperlipidemia, hypercholesterolidemia, bad cholesterol, fix all of those they have
accelerated. Atherosclerosis they may have. So you have to prevent that.
If the ischemia is due to hypertension treat hypertension.
and then for pain and altitude 6.
Or eventually you may have to refer them to a surgeon.
What do the surgeon do? Angioplast
and arterectomy? These are all atherosclerosis, treatment, arterial bypass procedures.
debridement of necrotic tissue, and the last one amputation.
I can tell you that every day
in our pathology department when I was there at Dallas Parkland Hospital.
They had at least couple of legs leg amputations
in the fridge when you come in the morning. Previous day surgery.
Usually we have 4, 5, 6, complete above, knee below knee, complete amputations due to
mainly due to venous ulcers, but some due to arterial ulcers as well.
That's very, very common, and the amputation is very common as well.
Sometimes you may have mixed venous ulcers, you see, these are punched out like arterial, but they are in the place of medial Myelotus, which is commonplace for venous ulcers, and also has the skin changes of the venous ulcers. Do you see
atrophy, Blanche, thin, whitish skin and pigment brownish pigment.
so you can have both of them mixed.
Now let's go to neuropathic ulcers.
These are on the pressure sites, and they are usually
thus circumscribed with a canvas around them.
They have a very thickened area peripheral.
and this is due to peripheral neuropathy, maybe associated with diabetes or any other type of any other cause of peripheral neuropathy maybe
seen and usually associated with decreased sensation in this area.
And there's no pain.
This type of ulcers do not have any pain.
There are neuropathic. But, as I mentioned, diabetes has 2 components, arterial component and neuropathic component.
And if it's the cause of the
neuropetic ulcers diabetes, you may have arterial ulcers as well.
Symptoms of sensory neuropathy can be seen.
And if diabetes.
then, if there's a vascular problem as well. You may have loss of pulses, but if there is no vascular component, the pulses are okay in neuropathic ulcers. If it's not due to advanced diabetes or atherosclerosis.
you may lose the reflexes because this is a neuropathic problem.
and they are usually on the pressure areas. As I mentioned.
sole toe heel. There is a thickness associated at the periphery. Great toe is a big area for this type of ulcers.
They are secondarily infected, and
the treatment of this is, you have to take the weight away from that pressure area
by any means possible.
Sometimes we guests, sometimes you have to debit the entire relation. Look at this. This is the typical
location of air.
Neuropathic ulcer. Painless center area is. There's a hole there. And circumferentially, there's a thickened skin that is the callus.
as you can see, that is the location.
Again. Look at the location.
These neuropathic ulcers, very well circumscribed, punched out, painless, with a very thickened callus at the periphery.
This happens to be again in a pressure area, has a very necrotic base.
but there is the thickening around again, and there's absence of the venous ulcers.
Now, pressure ulcers, decubitus ulcers, and this is usually seen and elderly bedridden patients
for a long time, that they are usually malnourished.
and they have arterial problems as well. This is a big problem in intensive care units prevention of these decubitus ulcers is one of the
main job of the nurses that are responsible for the patients in intensive care units. How do you do that by rolling the patient
to every couple of hours, or using special type of air beds for these.
So where do they occur? They occur usually in the sacral area or pelvic area where those bones are
on the bed. Actually think of the patient lying
on the on their back. And the areas that touch the bed are the areas that will have these kind of
ulcers and sacral area is the most common one. However, you may see them on the back of the heels.
knees. That's depending on how they how they are
sleeping. Okay, chronically bedridden patients and sometimes injury to spinal cord.
So there's ischemic damage and necrosis.
The mechanism is very straightforward.
There are some predisposing factors chronic debility, immobility.
And you're gonna see them. So basically, there is a staging for these ulcers device. And it's being used in intensive care units.
Stage one, non-blanching eritamus stage, 2. Necrosis of superficial dermis and shallow ulceration. Stage 3 deep necrosis stage 4. Then you are in the bone. You go towards the bone. It's the most advanced stage.
Let me show you examples of the these answers.
Right on the image on the right is showing you
the locations with stages, and that one on the sacrum is a stage 4, 1. You can even see the bone under that.
Okay, so this is stage 2 stage 2,
and this is superficial. Ulcer. Stage 3 is much deeper, and stage 4,
where you can see the bone and tendon and muscle. Here you can see the muscle in that area. So this is straightforward. This is very, very deep.
They give you 2 salsa, our pleasure also.
Again, like the Venus ulcers. Any any ulcer.
You can have squamous cell carcinoma arising in these ulcers as well. Longstanding ulcers don't ever don't forget that
squamous carcinoma so the management is
repositioning and that is done that is done by by successful nursing care you can avoid this. Ulcers, and
treating is very difficult. Avoidance is the most important thing. Prevention
and prophylaxis should include this skilled nursing number one, air mattress cleaning.
minimizing exposure to incontinence and wound drainage
and mobilize the patients as soon as you can. If you can.
That's the management of these answers.
Advanced management after the ulcer happened. That's the prevention debridement. Usually these are largely debrited by surgery.
Dressing sometimes skin flaps may be necessary, skin graft may be necessary.
and there's infection. You have to take care of the infection and prevent infection. I mentioned that
debridement. So this is what you are doing is you are removing the dead tissue on the left. There is a lot of that tissue. I don't know if you can appreciate that. But the green, this greenish stuff is all that, and this is a clean tissue
where you don't have any green, where you don't have any acritic materials.
And this is what you want to achieve eventually.
All right.
Now, ulcers due to other causes. So we covered venous. We covered arterial. We covered neuropathic, we covered pressure, the cubitus ulcers. Now, ulcers due to the other causes.
and these are skin ulcers, infection.
infection. Any type of infection can have skin ulcers, and there's a whole list of them.
Some of these infections are characterized by very deep ulcers in certain parts of the body where we are
talking about them. Maybe we are. Gonna
oh, see them! The last 2 Burulgarangeas are usually seen in Africa.
and they are associated with very deep, destructive type of ulcers.
However, any bacterial infection, any fungal infection, can cause large areas of ulceration
all right. Other causes of ulcers, artifact, or injury. You may have ulcers because of these pressure factors. When you have casts and plasters.
ski boots can can close artifact dermatitis artifact. Sometimes patients cause ulcers to seek attention
injecting drug users and burns are old, associated with ulceration of skin, self-inflicted ulceration.
This is coming in psychiatry. And these patients have these
injuries, and usually they are in accessible areas. And the inaccessible areas are okay. That's the only difference from the other type of ulcers. They are usually multiple. They are usually superficial, and the patient has some kind of problems.
Psychiatric problem, usually another ulcerating condition is associated with this skin condition.
Pyoderma gangrennosum, and this may be seen associated with Ibd inflammatory bowel disease and hematological malignancies. It's basically an extended form of skin necrosis.
They are painful. They develop very, very rapidly.
And there, if you see a couple of them. You are. Gonna recognize them in the
Correct clinical setting. They look like this. This patient had a Crohn's disease cribriform pattern of re-epithelialization
is characteristic crib reform pattern of re-epithelialization. Healing
is happening. My skin. But the skin is not covering entirely. It is in a Caribriform pattern
seen in Paoderma gangreneosum, which is seen associated with inflammatory bowel disease.
Vasculitis can cause, and we are going to cover vasculitis and any type of vasculitis large vessel, small vessel. Intermediate vessel. Multiple vessel
can cause skin ulcerations and ulcerations in any organ by blocking the artery.
Some of these are anchor associated small vessel vasculitis and those are anchor associated ones are weganers.
which is granumatosis with polyangiitis church. Strauss microscopic polarangitis. So those are all anchor associated vasculitis
and this is ulceration to do vasculitis.
These are irregular multiple ulcers, not in a typical pattern.
Another cause of ulceration is connective tissue disease, rheumatoid arthritis and systemic sclerosis are important
systemic sclerosis, especially the fingertips.
When the skin is tight. Sometimes on the face. In the tight areas the circulation may be impaired, and you may have these ulcers, especially in systemic sclerosis
and crest syndrome. Have you heard about crest syndrome, crest calcinosis, rhino
esophageal dysmotility sclerodactyly telangiectasia and these are usually associated with systemic sclerosis, associated skin ulcers.
hematological problems, sickle cell anemia, block the vessels, and you may have ulcers.
polycythemia, vera, and these all cause ulcers by blocking the vessels by the way, there is
due to lack of pet fusion, sickle cell ulcers.
It may cause large ulcers like this. It may cause small multiple ulcers.
This happens to be in the lower leg in the differential diagnosis with other type of venous ulcers.
Another ulcerating condition is necrobiosis lipoidica.
and this is associated with diabetes type one.
and these are large areas of very atrophic skin, and
eventually they ulcerate. And then you may have the biopsies from these and the biopsies are very characteristic. You have a central necrosis. The periphery is usually with palisading histiocytes, most of them on the shin and diabetes type. One diabetes is the common association. And this is what it looks like necrobiosis lipoidica. And
if they biopsy from the center, it's difficult to
diagnose if they get it from the periphery. You have more luck.
Calciphlaxis may cause ulceration. Calciphlaxis is calcium deposition in skin may be associated with kidney disease, or maybe primary calciflaxis. Hypercalcemia. Any condition.
Calcium almost acts like a foreign body may ulcerate the skin, and may prevent healing of the skin.
and these are usually in the lower leg ulcers.
and one way to demonstrate them by X-ray. If you take X-rays, you may see that there are ulcers, have the calcium, and sometimes deep calcium deposits are also present. This is an ulcer due to calcifluxus
pattern is very kind of irregular looking ulcer
to tell that this is calciflaxis one. You need a biopsy. You have to see calcium deposition in the tissue, or you take an X-ray.
you have to deposit that. And this is what you see on the X-ray.
See
the one on the right is showing you extensive calcium deposition in the skin. Any ulcer in that location is going to be due to calciflexes.
This anterior posterior is not showing you that well, but the lateral one is showing you much better
drugs. Some medications may cause ulcerations, and important one is hydroxyurea, leg ulceration delayed healing of the ulcers,
hydroxyurea.
When ulceration is due to underlying myeloproliferative disease. If these patients are using hydroxyurea.
they may cause ulcerations, or the ulcers may not heal ulceration due to hydroxyurea.
This patient was receiving this for 5 years, due to myelodysplastic syndrome.
and, as you can see, these are small relatively small ulcers.
a very small one on the dorsal side of the toe.
That is cause hydroxurea. And then
any else. We said that ulcers may cause cancer, but
cancers may ulcerate, cancers may cause ulcers also. Squamous carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma are notorious
for ulcerating and having ulcers so again.
longstanding ulcers can cause both squamous cycarcinoma and basal cyclarcinoma independent of also background.
These tumors, if they are not even associated with ulcers, can ulcerate.
and you can see malignancy ulcerating, and the reason for that is the vascular supply of the malignancy, the malignancy overgrow the vascular supply.
At the edges of squamous carcinoma.
Usually there is pseudotype of malignancy, which is called pseudoeptheromatous hyperplasia.
and that may be sometimes the only lesion, and you don't have to. You have to be careful not to over diagnose as malignancy, and that sort of epitheliomatous hyperplasia may be seen associated with
ulcers, ulceration due to malignancy, basil
cutaneous t-cell lymphoma all variations of ulcerations due to malignancy
that brings us to the end of our lecture. Thank you very much for your attention.
Any questions, please come over.
