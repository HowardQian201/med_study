make uploaded pdfs look better in upload_pdfs and study_session

worker task fail after time limit/retry logic

Make the task status display logic more sound
Store task ids in user table to poll from if logout log back in

    - set redis clear timer to 12 hours
    - should store when the task id was stored and remove after redis timer

Check what start command setting multiple threads means for 0.5 cpu in background worker
