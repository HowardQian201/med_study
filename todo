URGENT:


Make the task status display logic more sound
Store task ids in user table to poll from if logout log back in
    - Can we store this in redis?
    - user_id: [task_ids]

rate limit api calls
Make UI better



IDEAS:
realtime stats using posthog
supabase mcp with cursor

register new account
    - Payment page on register new account
    - supabase auth

Database indexing on question_sets.user_id, pdfs.hash, and quiz_questions.hash so that db queries are fast when querying

worker task retry logic

Caching layer
Look into question set hashing for same file
    - sometimes a new hashing


Combine quiz sets
implement some progress memorization from previous sessions
Stream quiz questions
switch to replit or vercel for deployment
Login page use google
Allow users to download quiz questions?
Create visual diagrams from summary
